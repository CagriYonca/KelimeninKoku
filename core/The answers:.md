In my current role at H&M in Dortmund, I led the design of a cost-effective data pipeline using Cloud Workflows, Cloud Scheduler, and optimized ETL processes. I bring expertise in API development, infrastructure automation with Terraform, and integration of security tools.

At Oredata, I played a crucial role in creating AVRO and ProtoBuf schemas, developing Cloud Functions scripts, and setting up Cloud Composer for data warehousing. My skills also include CDC configurations, Datastream usage, and Compute Engine instances with Python REST API.

I have a strong foundation in cloud technologies, data ingestion tools (Apache Spark, Kafka), and proficiency in monitoring tools (Ansible, Prometheus, Zabbix, Grafana, Splunk). My programming skills encompass Python, C++, Java, SQL, and Bash scripting.

I am eager to contribute to the success of the Data Engineer team player. Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my skills align with your team's objectives.
